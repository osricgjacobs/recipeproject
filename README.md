**Resepte (Recipe Project)**

**Project Overview:**
Dawn's Resepte is a simple, interactive, frontend-only recipe website built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The project digitises and preserves recipes from my mother handwritten recipe book which is focusing on classic South African comfort meals and desserts.

**Features:**
Semantic HTML
Recipes are structured using proper semantic elements:
<article>, <section>, <ol>, <h2> - improving accessibility, readability, and SEO.

Live Search / Filter
A built-in JavaScript filter allows users to search recipes instantly as they type.

Alphabetical Sorting (Planned)
Future update: all recipes will be sorted alphabetically via DOM manipulation to enhance navigation and user experience.

Responsive Design
Styled using Flexbox:
On mobile: recipes stack vertically.
On desktop: recipes display in a two-column layout.

Clean, Modern Aesthetic
Custom CSS (no frameworks) for a minimalist, modern, readable design.
